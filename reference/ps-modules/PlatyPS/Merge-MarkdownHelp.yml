  code: |-
    Merge-MarkdownHelp -Path @('Lync Server 2010\Test-CsPhoneBootstrap.md', 'Lync Server 2013\Test-CsPhoneBootstrap.md') -OutputPath lync

    The resulting file will be located at `lync\Test-CsPhoneBootstrap.md`.
  summary: |+
    The Test-CsPhoneBootstrap.md cmdlet is included in both Lync Server 2010 and Lync Server 2013.
    Much of the content is duplicated and thus we want to have a single file for the cmdlet with unique content merged from each individual file.

uid: platyPS.Merge-MarkdownHelp
name: Merge-MarkdownHelp
description: |-
  Similar modules, or different versions of the same module, often contain duplicate content.

  Merge-MarkdownHelp merges the multiple markdown files into a single markdown file.
  It uses the `applicable:` yaml metadata field to identify what versions or tags are applicable.
  It acts on two levels: for the whole cmdlet and for individual parameters.

  The resulting markdown contains the `applicable:` tags as well as all of the content of the original markdown files.
  Duplicate content is simply ignored.
  Content that is unique to each file is merged using **merge markers**, followed by a comma-separated list of applicable tags.
  A **merge marker** is a string of text that acts as a marker to describe the content that was merged.
  The default **merge marker** text consists of three exclamation points !!! however this can be changed to any relevant text using the **-MergeMarker** flag.
